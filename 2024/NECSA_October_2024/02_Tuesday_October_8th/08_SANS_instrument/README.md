(We in fact already have a velocity selector in place, think of it placed just left of the two slits.)

## TASKS
1. Find back your solution to the [velocity selector exercise](../../01_Monday_October_7th/04_Neutron_optics_exercises/Exercise_selector/) or use [the solution provided here](../../01_Monday_October_7th/04_Neutron_optics_exercises/Exercise_selector/solution/selector.instr)
