# "Virtual experiments": modelling SAFARI-1 instruments

In this session, we shall collect information about the existing SAFARI instruments.

## Powder Instrument For Transition In Structure Investigations (PITSI) 

This model already exists in McStas:

- `Necsa/SAFARI_PITSI`
- https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921452617310025
- [PITSI brochure](pics/PITSI_Brochure_V4_Final.pdf)

This instrument comes with a powder sample component. We suggest to try-out the
`Single_crystal` component in powder/texture mode. 
In addition, for those having access to `cif2hkl`, other materials from CIF files
are suggested. Last, one may assemble two different materials, next to each other 
in order to describe an interface or a phase change (e.g. different d-spacings).


## Materials Probe For Internal Strain Investigations (MPISI) 

This model already exists in McStas:

- `Necsa/SAFARI_MPISI`
- http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physb.2017.12.011
- [Benchmarjking MPISI](pics/Benchmarking_studies_of_the_MPISI_Materi.pdf)
