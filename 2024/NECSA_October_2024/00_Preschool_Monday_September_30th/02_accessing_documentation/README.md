# Accessing documentation
- Please use the command `mcdoc` in a terminal - or click Docs in `mcgui`
![mcdoc](11_mcdoc.png)
- the McStas `mcdoc` (and `mxdoc`for McXtrace) provides the main entry-point to documentation - will come in handy later.

- Once you feel ready, please proceed with [your first McStas simulation](../03_a_first_simulation/README.md)
