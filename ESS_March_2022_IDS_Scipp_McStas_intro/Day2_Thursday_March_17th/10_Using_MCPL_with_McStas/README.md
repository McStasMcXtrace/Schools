## MCPL practical (work in progress)

* Use the SANS_spheres instrument from the example directory
* Insert an MCPL_output after last slit, geometrically at the slit
* Comment out the remainder of the instrument
* Run a series of runs with this new primary instrument at different statistics
* Create a "backend" instrument that uses MCPL_input as a source
