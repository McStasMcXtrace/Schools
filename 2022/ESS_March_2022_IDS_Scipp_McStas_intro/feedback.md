# McStas workshop feedback

Andrew was not physically there, so a worse experience. Wanted overview, and feels he got that. Will ask less stupid questions.

Greg got a good overview. The practical exercises may have needed more preparation than anticipated, and felt lost when a existing instrument was needed.
Mentions that the environment is important, very noisy on the first day. Peter mentions going to a location to focus can make sense and has been done.

Peter suggests more online learning, information along with guided exercises.
Material on the different instrument classes and associated exercises, and material on instrument classes.
Online learning can always be postponed, Andrew was glad to have something in the calendar to focus.

SÃ¸ren thinks it was a good overview, but that it should be designed more for that purpose. Too much content. Exercises should be less open.
Was very nice to run the existing BEER instrument and realize that it doesn't correspond to reality, now he knows that there is work to do.

Jan-Lukas needed the event to actually get it into his schedule, as it is not critical to his role. Appreciates having an idea about the project now, but the first day was the most useful. Nexus discussion was important.

It was Celines third McStas workshop, thought the topics were well chosen. Appreciated quick help. Maybe 4 half days instead of 2 full would have been better. Some exercises skipped, but will attempt them on her own.

Docker worked really well for the workshop. There was a small issue on the McStasScript mcdisplay call that required Ply. Peter does recommend installing the full McStas if one wants to continue to work with the software.
