## TASK
Imagine if the higher orders were a problem, introduce a chopper into the guide to eliminate them

## HINTS
* The guide has to be split into two segments to accommodate the chopper
* Use DiskChopper, but set is_first to 0
* Ensure the distance between source and chopper is known
* Use declare and initialize to calculate appropriate delay
* McStas has a constant called K2V that converts from wavevector to velocity

## INTERPRETATION
Higher orders of scattering from monochromator should be removed.
