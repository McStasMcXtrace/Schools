# Practical session on optics

For this practical, if you have limited time select either the exercise with the CRL followed by KB-mirrors, or the one with the Monochromators.

## 1. [Compound refractive lenses](1_CRLs/)

For this exercise, you may get inspiration from the `Test_CRL.instr` example. 
   
## 2. [KB-mirror setup](2_KB_mirrors/)

There is also a `TwinKB_ML` component, used in the example `SAXS_saxlab.instr`. There is also the `XFEL_SPB` example with two sets of KB mirrors.

## 3. [Monochromators](3_Monochromators/)

For this exercise, you may get inspiration from the `Test_Mono.instr` example.
