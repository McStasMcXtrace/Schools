# Practical session on optics

For this practical, if you have limited time select either the exercise with the CRL followed by KB-mirrors, or the one with the Monochromators.

## 1. [Compound refractive lenses](1_CRLs/)

For this exercise, you may get inspiration from the [`Test_CRL.instr`](http://mcxtrace.org/download/components/3.0/examples/Test_CRL.html) example. 
   
## 2. [KB-mirror setup](2_KB_mirrors/)

There is also a [`TwinKB_ML`](http://mcxtrace.org/download/components/3.0/optics/TwinKB_ML.html) component, used in the example [`SAXS_saxlab.instr`](http://mcxtrace.org/download/components/3.0/examples/SAXS_saxlab.html). There is also the [`XFEL_SPB`](http://mcxtrace.org/download/components/3.0/examples/XFEL_SPB.html) example with two sets of KB mirrors.

## 3. [Monochromators](3_Monochromators/)

For this exercise, you may get inspiration from the [`Test_Mono.instr`](http://mcxtrace.org/download/components/3.0/examples/Test_Mono.html) example.
