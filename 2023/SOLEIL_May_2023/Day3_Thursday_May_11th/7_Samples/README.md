# Samples

McXtrace currently supports a set of samples:

- powder diffraction
- single crystal diffraction
- absorption spectroscopy (edge only, no pre-edge nor EXAFS)
- small angle scattering (with many models from SASview)
- fluorescence
- inelastic scattering (currently only isotropic density materials 2D IXS, no RIXS)

In the future we plan to add:

- photo-emission inelastic scattering (approx. 2D=XPS and 4D=ARPES)
- inelastic scattering in single crystals (4D IXS, no RIXS)

## Using "any-shape" geometry

## Combining samples

handle concentric and multiphase

using WHEN

using if !SCATTERED ABSORB

using GROUP
