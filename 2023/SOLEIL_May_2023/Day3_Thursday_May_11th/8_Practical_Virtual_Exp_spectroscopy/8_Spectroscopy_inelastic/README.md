# McXtrace training: samples and virtual experiment: spectroscopy/inelastic scattering

For this exercise, we shall use the existing Test_Sqw example.

## Building Sqw data files

You may re-use any existing Sqw file from the neutron side. These S(q,w) data sets contain low energy phonon in some materials. Among these, Germanium has the strongest speed of sound, and may be usable with X-rays.
