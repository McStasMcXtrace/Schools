# McXtrace training: samples and virtual experiments: spectroscopy

In this session we propose to use some spectroscopy sample models:

- Absorption (using `Filter`, `Absorption_sample`, `Abs_objects`, and `Fluorescence` components)
- Fluorescence, togeteher with absorption, Compton and Rayleigh scattering

For this session you should start with:

- [Absorption, the ROCK beam-line](8_Spectroscopy_abs)
- [Fluorescence, the LUCIA beam-line with hyper-spectral](8_Spectroscopy_fluo)

In addition, the `Isotropic_Sqw` is an experimental component that models an isotropic density material (powder, liquid, amorphous, polymer...) with dispersive coherent processes. This is a pure Thomson scattering (i.e. not RIXS, nor photo-emission). We shall not discuss this sample here, but there exists a `Test_Sqw` example that you may refer to.
