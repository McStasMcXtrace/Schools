### TASK
Replace the higher order suppressing chopper with a velocity selector which only
allows the deisred wavelength through.

### HINTS
* ```mcdoc V_selector```
* You may (mostly) use the default values coming from D11@ILL
* You will have to make more room for the velocity selector than for he chopper
* Declare extra variable(s) to be able to dynamically set the wavelength
